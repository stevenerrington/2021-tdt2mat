[**phy**](https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy) is an open-source Python library providing a graphical user interface for visualization and manual curation of large-scale electrophysiological data. It is optimized for high-density multielectrode arrays containing hundreds to thousands of recording sites (mostly [Neuropixels probes](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/neuropixels/)).

Phy provides two GUIs:

* **Template GUI** (recommended): for datasets sorted with KiloSort and Spyking Circus,
* **Kwik GUI** (legacy): for datasets sorted with klusta and klustakwik2.

## Installation instructions

Phy requires a recent GPU and an SSD for storing your data (the GUI may be slow if the data is on an HDD).

1. You need a recent Python distribution.

2. Open a terminal and type:

```bash
pip install phy --pre --upgrade
# If you plan to use the Kwik GUI, type the following without the leading hash # character:
# pip install klusta klustakwik2
```

3. Phy should now be installed. Open the GUI on a dataset as follows (the phy2 environment should still be activated):

```bash
cd path/to/my/spikesorting/output
phy template-gui params.py
```

### Dependencies

For your information, here are the Python dependencies of phy  (as found in `requirements.txt`):

```
phylib
mtscomp
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
h5py
dask
cython
pillow
colorcet
pyopengl
requests
qtconsole
tqdm
joblib
click
mkdocs
PyQtWebEngine
```



### Dealing with the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidget`

In some environments, you might get an error message related to QtWebEngineWidget. Run the command `pip install PyQtWebEngine` and try launching phy again. This command should not run if the error message doesn't appear, as it could break the PyQt5 installation.


### Upgrading from phy 1 to phy 2

* Do not install phy 1 and phy 2 in the same Python environment.
* It is recommended to delete `~/.phy/*GUI/state.json` when upgrading.


### Developer instructions

To install the development version of phy in a fresh environment, do:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cortex-lab/phy.git
cd phy
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:cortex-lab/phylib.git
cd phylib
pip install -e . --upgrade
```

### Troubleshooting

* [See a list of common issues.](https://phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting/)
* [Raise a GitHub issue.](https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy/issues)


## Running phy from a Python script

In addition to launching phy from the terminal with the `phy` command, you can also launch it from a Python script or an IPython terminal. This may be useful when debugging or profiling. Here's a code example to copy-paste in a new `launch.py` text file within your data directory:

```
from phy.apps.template import template_gui
template_gui("params.py")
```
