Welcome to JRCLUST's documentation!
===================================

JRCLUST is a scalable and customizable package for `spike sorting`_ written in `MATLAB`_ and `CUDA`_.
JRCLUST runs on a local workstation (it is recommended, but not required, that you have a GPU).

The original JRCLUST paper by Jun, et al., may be found on the `bioRxiv <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/30/101030>`_.
